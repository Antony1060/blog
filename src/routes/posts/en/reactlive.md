So you might have noticed(or not) that I was gone for around 3 months. Well, I wasn't gone per-se but this blog has been pretty inactive.
Well, I'll try to share everything that happened in this kinda short post, and also use it as an excuse for my lazyness.

## So what happened?
Apart from me being lazy, one big thing that happened was [React Live](https://reactlive.nl).

Before I continue, I would just like to thank the really amazing folks at [(PP) Passionate People](https://passionatepeople.io) and <Profile name="luc" /> for making all this possible. Thanks to them, I managed to get basically free VIP enterence into the conference. Of couse, we had to pay ourselves for the flight and the stay, but it was very much worth it. This was also a really good opportunity to go visit another country espessially after the Covid outbreak.

***Note:***I'll mostly talk in 1st person plural throughout this post since **we** will refer to my family and me

### The trip
We began our trip Thursday morning, March 31st, the day before the conference. Apart from this being my first conference, it was also my very first time in an airplane.
The flight to Amsterdam was very nice, with almost no hiccups along the way. Unfortunately, it was unexpectedly windy there in Amsterdam, but that didn't really affect me since I spend the most of Thursday at the PP office and at the theatre preparing for the big day on Friday.

I'll skip Friday for now as that was the big day and I'll go over in the [next section](#the-conference). We spend the rest of our days in Amsterdam just looking around and getting a bit more familiar with the city. And I must day, Amsterdam is really beautiful. If you ever get the chance to go somewhere, I would definetely recommend Amsterdam.

### The conference
It was kind of funny that the conference itself happend on the 1st of April. It would've been really hilarious if the conference was just one big prank.
Apart from the weather being... well... snowy, everything went pretty smoothly. The conference itself was really an experience, and you really get to realize how much you still got to learn after you meet some of the people there.

I would also like to thank <Profile name="josgerards" /> for being such an amazing organizer and making the whole conference possible.
